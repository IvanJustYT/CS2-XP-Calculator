# CS2 XP Calculator üèÖüßÆ
My first ever web page, aimed at making earning a Service Medal in CS2 a whole lot easier.

## Features
With this tool you can calculate how much time you have to play every day, in order to get a certain Medal at the end of the year.

You are able to select:
- **Your Current Medal**
- **Your Desired Medal**
- **Current Level (and XP)**
- **Base XP Earned per hour (or Deathmatch Score)**

## How to use
The tool is really easy to use, all you have to do is input the values stated above and hit 'Calculate' (there is a help section in the website)

You can also see how the tool is used in [this video](https://youtu.be/Bks0AsPJjPM) I made.

## Possible Features
I may add features in the future based on demand, or just stuff that I find cool

For now, I'm thinking of adding:
- **Custom End Date**
in case you want the Medal before the end of the year
- **XP Calculator** (the opposite of this), to see how much XP you will earn in a given time
- **More Languages** for those who don't speak English or Russian

If you have any more ideas, feel free to share them in my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TWkrtHuc8w), or under a Youtube video of mine!
